# Tetris RL

An agent learns to play Tetris through reinforcement learning. The primary algorithm for the agent is Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a heuristic search algorithm commonly used for games. The implementation uses a screen capture of a Tetr.io window to directly input moves into the game.
